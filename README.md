# ML_Salary_Prediction_based_on_experience

In this project, I developed multiple machine learning models to predict salaries based on work experience.  

By examining the relationship between experience and salary, the models provide accurate salary estimates, 

assisting both employers and job seekers in understanding market trends and making informed decisions.
